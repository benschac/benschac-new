# RC return statement

<Spacer size='$4' />

## TL;DR

<Spacer size='$4' />
RC is a lot of fun, if you like programming, or want to get better at
programming on your own, [apply to a batch](https://www.recurse.com/apply).
There isn't a syllabus, or course. Just you, your computer, and a (zoom) or
physical room, of other like minded folks doing the same thing, scratching a
programming itch that they didn't have the time or space to before.

<Spacer size='$4' />
Its a great way to learn about what you don't know you don't know

<Spacer size='$4' />I initially joined recurse center's programming community in
the Winter 2 '16 batch. While I didn't technically write a return statement
then, I did write a little bit about my experience
[here](https://medium.com/free-code-camp/how-i-got-my-first-dev-job-and-what-im-going-to-do-next-4837b1e9c89c).

## Goals
<Spacer size='$4' />

I had an idea of what I was looking for out of my batch. Overwhelmingly, the goal was to have fun this time around. Not to get too hung up on anything and just enjoy the time for what it is. That and to program with as many people as I could.

<Spacer size='$4' />
One of my regrets from my first batch was not pairing with other people enough.
Pairing at RC is uniquely different than pairing at a job. There's no code
review, no need for anything other than enjoying the creative process with
others, having fun and learning something new along the way. Pairing is one of
the best ways I found to [learn
generously](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#learn-generously) during a
batch.

<Spacer size='$4' />I broke down the half-batch as much as I thought made sense,
While I ended up not sticking to the initial plan, but I did mostly stick to
having fun with my time and programming at the [edge of my
ability](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#work-at-the-edge).

<Spacer size='$4' />
My initial outline of how I planned my half-batch is
[here](https://excalidraw.com/#json=e0Ri4I3vG6cG1HrA-piQB,JYbZ6-6GGpFTeObAuv9KaQ)

<Spacer size='$4' />I ended up loosing about about a week to holiday, sick days
and family obligations, which really made the time fly even faster.

## Projects

<Spacer size='$4' />

### Done

<Spacer size='$4' />

‚úÖ [linear todo comment VSCode plugin](https://github.com/benschac/linear-vscode-todo) and here on the [VSCode market place](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=benschac.linear-todo)

<Spacer size='$2' />
‚úÖ [game of life 3D
WASM](https://github.com/benschac/game-of-life-wasm-three-js). this was my first
**real** Rust project. I got a lot of help, and learned a whole bunch, was a
great push toward your edge type of project.
<Spacer size='$2' />
‚úÖ [creative coding sessions]()
<Spacer size='$2' />
‚úÖ [friend Github commit art]()
<Spacer size='$2' />‚úÖ SVG generator

<Spacer size='$4' />
### In progress
<Spacer size='$4' />

‚è∞ [mdx blog](https://github.com/benschac/tmp-project-repo)

<Spacer size='$2' />
‚è∞ [Recurse Typescript API]('TODO')
<Spacer size='$2' />‚è∞ [Recurse Typescript SDK]('TODO')

<Spacer size='$4' />
### Failed
<Spacer size='$4' />

üõë Getting a Rust module to ffi into an expo react-native project.

<Spacer size='$2' />
üõë Doing react-native animations (I just didn't do them)

<Spacer size='$2' />
üì≤ I didn't stick with writing swift or expo modules - Blob / Spline in
react-native

<Spacer size='$4' />
## Day-to-day
<Spacer size='$4' />

‚úÖ I ended up both pairing for the first 13 days straight, which the goal was to pair daily, but I felt like I wasn't getting into work I wanted to really dig into

<Spacer size='$2' />‚úÖ I picked a project or task to commit to for a couple of
days, but always had something else to work on to interleave / keep moving on if
I felt the need to procrastinate or just needed to take a break with a change of
code scenery.

<Spacer size='$4' />
## learning resources
<Spacer size='$4' />

üò¢ spent a good bit of time on `three-journey` but abandoned it.

<Spacer size='$2' />
‚è∞ got through about half of [rustlings]()
<Spacer size='$2' />
‚è∞ I did a good amount of the type-challenges (most of the easy and a couple
medium)
<Spacer size='$2' />
üôÉ I did a good amount of LeetCode, but probably should have done more and more
consistently

<Spacer size='$4' />
## good
<Spacer size='$4' />

üßëüèª‚Äçüíª I programmed everyday. I didn't commit to Github daily, which I stupidly have anxiety about.

<Spacer size='#2' />
üé® I went to creative coding most every week. I had a great time! Creative
coding was a time / space where there was a prompt, and folks would make digital
art. The meetings had a tight time box, and a theme to focus on. It was the
perfect short scope time to work with others, or try something new to get your
head out of whatever you were currently working on.

<Spacer size='$2' />
## bad
<Spacer size='$4' />

ü•∫ anxiety never sleeps! never stops creeping, ever. I think I could have found better ways to deal with it.

<Spacer size='$2' />
üìù I stopped checking in on zulip after the 3rd week, which is silly! Both from
the learning generously side of things, because other batch mates cannot lurk on
what you're doing, and join in if it's something they're interested in. Also, to
myself, posting regularly is a great habit to get into. It's just generally a
great way to reflect on the time spent, and recalibrate if needed.

<Spacer size='$4' />
## okay

<Spacer size='$4' />

üì≤ I wish I would have done more react-native and swift / Kotlin

## Learning in public

- [learn generously](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#learn-generously)

> Learning generously takes many forms. It means sharing your curiosities, interests, and struggles with others; being open to collaboration; and listening well and asking good questions when others share their work with you. If you‚Äôre very social and enjoy variety, it might mean hosting events or pairing on other people‚Äôs projects. If you‚Äôre focused on one project and work best alone, it might mean presenting your work and sharing updates as you go.

## [building](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#volitional-muscles)

> Building your volitional muscles means growing your ability to make decisions about your work and learning based on your own curiosity and joy, rather than external pressures and fears.
