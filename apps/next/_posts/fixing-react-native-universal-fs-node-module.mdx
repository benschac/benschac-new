# Intro

Documenting for both my future self and anyone else on the world wide web who may run into the same issue.

I bootstrapped my project with [`yarn create tamagui`](https://tamagui.dev/) using the free web + mobile template.

While building my personal site and react-native play ground I ran into this issue when trying to build my `expo` project

```bash
The package at "../../node_modules/next/dist/compiled/gzip-size/index.js" attempted to import the Node standard library module "fs".
```

The steps I took to debug the issue:

❌ Removed mdx deps

❌ copied tamagui example

❌ hard reset yarn and make deps use v3

❌ commented out places where fs is used

❌ commented out rss

❌ commented out all screens

❌ removed all next references from the project

❌ commend out fs fallback nextjs config

## The Solution

Running the `yarn why` command in the `expo` directory

```bash
y why next
└─ next-app@workspace:apps/next
   └─ next@npm:14.2.5 [1e21e] (via npm:^14.2.3 [1e21e])
```

Next was still being imported into the project, directly.

I was still importing `@my/ui`. After looking through the components directory, `Layout` was importing `next/router`.

After replacing `next/router with `solito/router` the project built successfully.
