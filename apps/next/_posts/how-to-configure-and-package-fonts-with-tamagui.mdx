# How To Configure and Package Fonts with Tamagui

Documenting my journey for both my future self and others who might run into the same problem.

## Problem

I was trying to add a font using Tamagui's font generation tool, but, the correct font wasn't being rendered to the web.

Importing both the correct font files for web, mobile and general configuration is tetious, and error prone and just generally something that most developers don't want to spend time on.

### Using the correct file type

For web using the `woff2` file type is the most performant, and generally the best option. For mobile, using the `otf` file type.

### Base64 encoding

I did a bit of searching and didn't find a compelling reason to use base64 encoding for fonts. [It's generally not recommended, and can cause performance issues](https://csswizardry.com/2017/02/base64-encoding-and-performance/).
