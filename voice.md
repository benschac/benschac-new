## App description:

I want to create a voice-based note-taking app.

## App flow and functionality:

The flow of the app is as follows:

- User opens the app, and there is a play/start button to start recording your voice.
- When the user clicks on the button, it asks for permission to access the microphone.
- If the user clicks allow, the app starts recording and the button changes to a stop button.
- When the user clicks on the stop button, the app stops recording and transcribes the voice note using the Deepgram real-time voice API.
- While the user is speaking, there is a clean, simple animation on the screen along with the realtime transcription of the voice note.
- The user can click the stop button to stop the recording.
- After ther is done recording, the note is automatically saved with the date, time, and the transcription of the voice note into the Firebase Firestore database.
- Now, the app displays the note in a list of all notes on the home screen.

This application is set-up with existing configuration for Deepgram APIs and Supabase. Implement all the functionality in the flow above while using the existing codebase as a starting point, but fully modify the codebase to fit the flow and functionality described above.
